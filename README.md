AWS Resource tracking using shell scripting

## Introduction

Tracking AWS resources using shell scripting can be useful for various purposes like monitoring, cost management, and automation. Hereâ€™s a basic approach to get you started on tracking AWS resources using shell scripting:

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI**: Ensure you have the AWS Command Line Interface (`awscli`) installed and configured with appropriate IAM credentials.
2. **Shell Scripting Environment**: Write and execute shell scripts using a Unix-like shell (e.g., Bash).

## Steps

- Check whether the AWS CLI is installed.
- Configure the AWS using aws configure.


- Assign the name to the file with the extension .sh
- Write the script for tracking the resources


- Change the file permissions.
- Execute the file ./ followed by the name of the file and for better output give more
- You will get the output, a list of buckets, and lambda functions.


- List of IAM Users.


- Same ways you can also track many other AWS resources.

### Conclusion

This script provides a starting point for tracking AWS resources using shell scripting. Depending on your specific requirements, you can extend and customize it further. Always test scripts in a controlled environment before deploying them to production to ensure they meet your needs and perform as expected.
